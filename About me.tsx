            <p>A company profile describes what makes your company unique. It automatically differentiates your brand because no other company has the exact same founding story and reason for existing that your business does.
                 Your history and values are integral parts of your brand positioning strategy, and a company profile is where you can mention this information without it feeling extraneous or out of place.
                 You can justify a higher price point for your products and services, if you go into details about your production values or ethically-sourced materials.
                 For instance, Starbucks’ coffee may not necessarily be better than Dunkin’ Donuts’ coffee, but because Starbucks goes into details about its high-quality ingredients,
                  it immediately creates the sense that you’ll be paying a little more for a "better" product.
                  What do you want your company to be known for?Is your company the one that started as a small family-owned shop that grew into a billion-dollar enterprise?
                  Or is it a company that upholds sustainability and puts ethics at the forefront of its brand? You can build your reputation through marketing, service, and sales campaigns, but it all begins with a well-curated first impression.</p>
